functional_damage_definitions: |
  NO FUNCTIONAL DAMAGE — The target is undamaged or sustained no or minimal damage to critical element(s), causing no decrease in normal functional capability. The target is fully operational or capable of action (i.e. mission ready). This damage level does not require recuperation or replacement times.
  LIGHT FUNCTIONAL DAMAGE — The critical element(s) of the target have sustained damage, causing less than a 15 percent decrease in normal operational capability. This damage level requires an estimate of the time required for recuperation or replacement of the target function.
  MODERATE FUNCTIONAL DAMAGE — The critical element(s) of the target have sustained damage, causing a 15-45 percent decrease in normal operational capability. This damage level requires an estimate of the time required for recuperation or replacement of the target function.
  SEVERE FUNCTIONAL DAMAGE — The critical element(s) of the target have sustained damage, causing greater than 45 percent decrease in normal operational capability. This damage level requires an estimate of the time required for recuperation or replacement of the target function.
  FUNCTIONALLY DESTROYED — The critical element(s) of the target have sustained damage rendering the target unusable for its original purpose. The target is incapable of supporting combat or production operations without repair or replacement of critical elements. This damage level requires an estimate of the time required for recuperation or replacement of the target function.
  As required, use the following functional damage definitions in situations when the basic definitions above do not apply.
  ABANDONED — Regardless of physical damage, this facility or equipment is no longer used for its intended purpose. The target is incapable of supporting combat or production operations without being reoccupied and/or re-equipped.
  UNKNOWN FUNCTIONAL DAMAGE — Although the critical element(s) of the target have been attacked, there is insufficient data to assess if any functional damage occurred.
